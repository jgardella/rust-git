Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index. git rm will not remove a file from just your working directory. (There is no
option to remove a file only from the working tree and yet keep it in the index; use /bin/rm if you want to do that.) The files being removed have to
be identical to the tip of the branch, and no updates to their contents can be staged in the index, though that default behavior can be overridden
with the -f option. When --cached is given, the staged content has to match either the tip of the branch or the file on disk, allowing the file to be
removed from just the index.")]
